# AutoHotKey buff script for Path of Exile

Based heavily on [work by Joel Stanford](https://github.com/JoelStanford/PoEAutoFlask).
Refactored into a separate library and per-character scripts, for ease of switching.

Hopefully the code & examples are self explanatory...

Relies on [AutoHotKey](https://www.autohotkey.com/).
Tested with `v1.1.32.00`.

The script indicates its status with an on-screen tooltip.
Either:

- run PoE in "Windowed Fullscreen" so the tooltip can be drawn over the screen
- disable tooltips; comment out the lines that start with "Tooltip" by prepending them with "; "
